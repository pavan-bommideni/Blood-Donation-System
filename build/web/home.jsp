We don't just need to give blood in the event of tragedies or emergencies. Instead, it should be a normal and routine part of our lives. 
Remember that men can give blood up to four times a year - women up to three times -providing there are at least two months between donations.
It is a safe and easy process which takes approximately 45 minutes.
Generally, anyone age 16 or older weighing at least 110 pounds and in good health, can donate blood.</h3>

        <h3 style="color:white">Organ donation is the donation of biological tissue or an organ of the human body, from a dead person to a living being in need of a transplantation.
It saves lives. Many organs can be donated, including liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart and lungs. Tissues can also be donated, such as skin, corneas and heart valves.
It can be hard to think about what's going to happen to your body after you die,so better we donate our organs.
The biggest advantage to organ donation is it saves lives that would otherwise be lost.
A single organ donor has the chance to save the lives or improve the quality of life for several people.
